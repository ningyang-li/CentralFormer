Training, validation, test sets, and the samples for prediction can be downloaded in Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Htr4jgtJyRT24VSbVbg2jED7kXAYUGqV?usp=drive_link)  

After download all files, please put them in a folder named "samples".

You can also generate the same samples with the random seed 42 we used.
