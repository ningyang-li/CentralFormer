Our manuscript "**CentralFormer: Centralized Spectral-Spatial Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification with Adaptive Relevance Estimation and Circular Pooling**" has been accepted by ***IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)***.

We have uploaded a simplified code file which contains the proposed model and parameter configuration.
The complete files, including code, data sets, training weights, and etc., will be supplemneted soon.

Here we are so grateful to all reviewers and editors for their constructive comments.
