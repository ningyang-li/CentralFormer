Our manuscript "**CentralFormer: Centralized Spectral-Spatial Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification with Adaptive Relevance Estimation and Circular Pooling**" has been accepted by ***IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)***.

We have uploaded a simplified code file of the proposed model.

We will supplement the complete files, including code, data sets, training weights, and etc., as soon as possible. :)

Here we are so grateful to all reviewers and editors for their constructive comments.

Thanks for your attention.
